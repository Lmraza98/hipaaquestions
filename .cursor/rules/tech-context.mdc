# Project Tech Context
- Use Next.js 15 with the App Router. By default Next.js 15’s App Router uses React 19 RC:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} and supports TypeScript (including `next.config.ts`):contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
- Style the site with Tailwind CSS for utility-first design. Assume a standard `tailwind.config.js` setup.
- Deploy on Vercel: default to serverless or Edge runtimes (no custom server). Node 18+ LTS is used.
- The project name is **HIPAAquestions.com**: it’s a HIPAA directory / lead generator, so assume HIPAA compliance is mandatory across all code.
