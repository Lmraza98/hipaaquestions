# Dynamic Form Builder Planning
- Use a modular component architecture for the form builder UI:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}: e.g. `FormBuilder` (main interface), `FieldPalette` (list of field types), `Canvas` (drag-and-drop area), `FieldConfigurator`, etc.
- Maintain form schema in a central state (e.g. React Context or Redux):contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}. The schema should be a JSON object/array describing fields, labels, types, validation, and conditional logic.
- Consider a **FormFactory** component: it takes a form schema object and renders appropriate input components dynamically:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}. Each field type (text, date, etc.) is a reusable React component.
- Decouple form definition from rendering: the builder creates/saves a JSON form definition (backend storage), and a runtime component reads that definition to render the actual form.
- Ensure validations and conditional logic are part of the schema. On submission, use Server Actions or API routes to process form data securely.
