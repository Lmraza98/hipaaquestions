# Tailwind CSS and UX Best Practices
- Write semantic HTML and apply Tailwind utility classes for styling. Ensure markup (buttons, forms, headings) is meaningful for accessibility.
- Configure `tailwind.config.js` with purge/content paths to remove unused CSS. This keeps the bundle lean:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}.
- Extend Tailwind’s theme for custom colors and breakpoints. Use `@apply` for common patterns if needed, but avoid inline styles when possible.
- Use responsive utility prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, etc.) for mobile-first design. Test on various screen sizes.
- Ensure high color contrast for text and UI elements to meet WCAG guidelines. Use Tailwind color utilities (e.g. `text-gray-900`, `bg-white`) with sufficient contrast.
- Include focus and hover states: e.g. `focus:ring` for buttons, and use `aria-` attributes on interactive elements. Don’t remove focus outlines by default.
