# HIPAA-Sensitive UX Writing
- Display a clear HIPAA compliance statement or privacy notice on the site (e.g. "All form data is handled in a HIPAA-compliant manner"):contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}.
- Use clear, empathetic language. Explain why health information is needed, and reassure users their data is protected.
- Avoid technical jargon. Make instructions concise. For example, say “Your protected health information (PHI) is secure” rather than legalese.
- Add informative prompts around PHI fields (e.g. “We use this information only for [purpose] and keep it confidential”).
- Consistently refer to sensitive info as PHI and define it on a help or footer section if needed.
